This tool adds customizable hotkeys to switch between layers and tools.

# Important
## Maintenance Mode  
This repository is no longer receiving active attention. In my opinion this module is complete and stable, and i'll be focusing my efforts on other modules/stuff. PR's are welcome and i'll try to investigate bugs and keep this module up to date with Foundry, when i find the time to do so.  
That said, feel free to keep suggesting features, if i find something interesting i may end up implementing it.


## FVTT Version compatibility
My focus is the FVTTs stable branch. I will neither promise nor prioritise updates for FVTTs beta or alpha branches! Feel free to report a bug so i know whats coming, but don't expect a fix before a stable FVTT update.

## Bug Reporting
Go to the [GitHub's issue board](https://github.com/Moerill/Layer-Hotkeys/issues) and check if the Bug is already reported. If not first test with all other modules disabled! If the bug persists create a new issue, with at least the following information:
1. Module version
2. FVTT version
3. Browser and OS used. Or if the app itself is used.
4. Bug description
	- What happened?
	- What should've happened?
	- Console errors? (F12 or F11 in most browsers)
5. Workflow to recreate the bug
6. Helpful videos or screenshots if possible
7. Either activate notifications, stay active or post your discord handle so i can get back to you for further questions  

**I will only take a quick glance at half hearted bug reports or Discord mentions! Don't expect me to react there!**
